/**
 * Planning (EQ-02, ADR 0023 § Modules, ADR 0025), under `/v1/scheduling`.
 *
 * Time. A shift is the half-open range [`startsAt`, `endsAt`) of two UTC instants (ADR 0011): it covers its start and
 * stops covering at its end, so a shift that ends at 06:00 and the next one that starts at 06:00 never overlap. A
 * screen shows the instants in the zone it chooses (the grid's, the reader's, the member's). Only the slots and the
 * templates speak in wall-clock time, in the grid's zone (`SchedulingSettings.timeZone`), and they become instants
 * when a template makes its shifts: a slot keeps its wall-clock hours across a change of time, so a 6-hour night slot
 * lasts 5 or 7 hours that night.
 *
 * Instants on the minute. `startsAt` and `endsAt` fall on a minute (seconds and milliseconds at zero), and a shift
 * lasts `SHIFT_MAX_MINUTES` at most: anything else answers 400 `shift_range_invalid`.
 *
 * Wall-clock times that do not exist or happen twice. A template's hour that falls in the spring gap (02:30 on the
 * last Sunday of March in Paris) becomes the first instant after the gap (03:00); an hour that happens twice in the
 * autumn becomes the first of the two. The `scheduling` module converts, and its tests hold both cases. A template
 * lasts `SHIFT_TEMPLATE_MAX_MINUTES` at most, so that a change of time never stretches one of its shifts past a day.
 *
 * On shift (`onShift`, glossary « En poste »). A member is on shift on an account at an instant `at` when they are
 * `active` and one of their shifts there, not cancelled, has `startsAt ≤ at < endsAt`. Their access window (ADR 0025,
 * EQ-13) widens it by `accessMarginMinutes` on each side, `startsAt − margin ≤ at < endsAt + margin`, with two
 * exceptions: a shift a person stopped while under way (`stoppedAt`, see `UpdateShiftBodySchema`) gets no margin
 * after its end, and a member who is not `active` has no window at all, whatever their shifts. A cancelled shift
 * counts for neither. The server computes both from the database at each request, never from a request and never
 * from a cache: a shift cancelled, moved, shortened or stopped counts as it now is from the next request on.
 *
 * Who reads which. The routing of a « sale » handover (EQ-13), `OnDuty` and `MyShifts.current` read `onShift`, without
 * the margin: a sale never goes to a chatter who is only in their margin. Only the creators' list of ADR 0025
 * (`shiftCreatorIds`) reads the window, per creator: a chatter whose window is open on any account of a creator keeps
 * that creator.
 *
 * One member, one account, one instant. The database decides it, not a read before the write: two exclusion
 * constraints (`btree_gist`, `tstzrange(starts_at, ends_at, '[)')`, cancelled shifts aside) keep a member off two
 * shifts at once and an account off two members at once, so two people planning at the same moment cannot both win.
 * A violation (23P01) answers 409 `shift_member_conflict` or `shift_account_conflict`; the server then reads the
 * shift in the way and gives it in `details.shiftId`.
 *
 * The past is kept. A shift that has ended (`endsAt ≤ now`) no longer changes: 409 `shift_ended_conflict`. A shift
 * under way may only be shortened, stopped or cancelled; any other change answers 409 `shift_started_conflict`. A new
 * shift ends after now. A cancelled shift is never sent back, and changing it answers `shift_not_found`.
 *
 * Creator and account. A shift and a template name both: the server checks that the account is the creator's
 * (`platform_account_not_found` otherwise), and the database holds the pair by a composite foreign key
 * `(platform_account_id, creator_id)` to `platform_accounts (id, creator_id)`, so that no row can open the wrong
 * creator in `shiftCreatorIds`.
 *
 * Leaves and swaps (ADR 0031). A leave is the member's, not a creator's: whole days of their own zone, asked by them,
 * approved or refused by the owner or an active manager (never by the member themselves), once no shift of theirs
 * covers it any more. While it is approved, no shift lands on them: by hand, by a template (the occurrence shows in
 * `conflicts` as `member_on_leave`) or by a swap. A swap is between chatters, without a manager (Charles, 27/10): a
 * chatter gives a shift that has not started to an active colleague of the same creator, or exchanges it for one of
 * theirs; the colleague accepts or declines, and an acceptance moves the shifts at once, under the rules of a shift set
 * by hand. The owner and an active manager see every swap and can revert one before either shift starts. The server
 * decides a leave's approval and every write that puts a shift on a member under one lock per member, so that an
 * approval and a new shift at the same moment cannot both win.
