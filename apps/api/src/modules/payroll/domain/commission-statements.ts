/**
 * The commission statements of a period (EQ-04, ADR 0023 § Les règles d'Imperium, § Paie): pure, the same input gives
 * the same statements, without a clock or the database. Imperium's rules, unchanged:
 * - per account, on the account's total for the period (never sale by sale): gross → euros → excluding VAT → net of
 *   the platform's commission → the member's share, each step rounded to the cent and nowhere else;
 * - the highest individual bonus tier reached by the member's net, managers excluded;
 * - the collective goal on the team's net, managers' sales included, its bonus to every chatter it covers, managers
 *   excluded, sales or not;
 * - manual bonuses, managers included;
 * - fixed and percent penalties, the percent on the member's net, capped at the member's share plus bonuses;
 * - a manager's share of the team's net;
 * - what comes in from earlier periods (carry-overs, adjustments), and a total under the payout minimum carried over.
 * Two points differ from Imperium's code, as the ADR and the task sheet decide: a penalty is capped at the member's
 * share plus bonuses, never at the net plus bonuses (a statement is never negative), and a manager's share of the
 * team's net leaves out the manager's own net, already paid by the manager's commission.
